# JSON Support

> This feature is in preview and documentation on it is not yet included in the official release.

Due to the fact JSON is a really popular format in big data, we thought we've obliged to support the path of importing/exporting data from/to JSON.

JSON support is implemented as a separate library [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Parquet.Net.Json.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Parquet.Net.Json) which you need to install in addition to the core library, and depends on the popular [Json.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) package. 

## Reading JSON

## Writing JSON

Parquet.Net does not support writing to JSON at the moment, however this is currently on our roadmap.
