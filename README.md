# parquet-dotnet

A .NET library to read and write [Apache Parquet](https://github.com/Parquet) files.

## Why

Parquet library is mostly available for Java, C++ and Python, which somewhat limits .NET/C# platform in big data applications. Whereas C# is a great language we still don't have anything good in this area.

This project is aimed to fix this problem.

## Roadmap

We have just started to work on this library, contributors are welcome.

## Notes

We use [Thrift for .NET Core](https://github.com/apache/thrift/tree/master/lib/netcore)
